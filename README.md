🎨 UI Overview
🖥️ Web Interface Preview:
<img src="demo.png" alt="Stroke Prediction UI" width="800">

Input Fields: Enter your health data (age, gender, BMI, glucose level, etc.).

Prediction Button: Click "Predict" to check stroke risk.

Result Display: The app will show either "High Risk of Stroke" or "Low Risk of Stroke".

🏆 How the Model Works
🔍 The model predicts stroke probability using features like:

Age 📅

Hypertension ❤️

Heart Disease 🏥

Smoking Status 🚬

BMI & Glucose Levels 🍏

⚡ Behind the Scenes:

The input data is transformed using StandardScaler.

The trained model (Stroke_model.pkl) predicts the probability of stroke.

If the probability is ≥ 0.5, the prediction is "High Risk", else "Low Risk".

❓ Troubleshooting
🔹 Solution: Ensure scaler.pkl is applied before making predictions.

⚠️ Issue: ModuleNotFoundError
🔹 Solution: Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install dependencies.

⚠️ Issue: Web app not opening
🔹 Solution: Try running flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000.

🚀 Future Enhancements
🚀 Deploy on Heroku / Render for global access
